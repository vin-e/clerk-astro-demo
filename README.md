# Clerk and Astro SSR Template

## Introduction

This project is based on [Astro 4.0](https://astro.build) blank template and pulls in [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) authentication via their vanilla js client side and backend libraries. This template is a clone of the [Next.js and Clerk](https://github.com/clerk/clerk-nextjs-demo-app-router/) demo project.

The dashboard is currently using react components to render the user, session and organization information. As noted in the [TO DO List](#to-do-list) I plan to add a few additional variations of the dashboard page.

### View it live
